      <h3 class="name mbs">Jonathan Dharmadi | He/Him/His | Running for Content Creator</h3>
      <p class="description mbs">I want to give back to the new media community that has raised me, which is why I am running for the role of content creator. With this role, I want to show the world what new media can do but broadening our scope and showcasing student projects, and let our voices be heard. I also want to provide updates to all members on events throughout the week through some fun visuals. I will work to foster a welcoming community, connect us with our expansive alumni network, And most importantly, ensure that everyone explores their passion and has the necessary resources to do so.</p>

      <p class="description mbs">5'9" and 160lbs of pure hot dog meat and cosmic energy. I can only do karaoke to Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville and I took four years of physics. Now you may be asking, how does that make me a good leader? well, it doesn't, BUT I was class president in high school and team captain on my tennis team so that may mean something. Also, I can definitely fight a coyote if necessary and I was voted most likely to survive the zombie apocalypse so if shit goes south I'm the guy you want leading us to then next stage of society. At the end of the day,  New media is my passion and switching into this major was worth all the effort it took. I may joke but I wouldn't be here if I didn't firmly believe that I could handle the job and help improve the club as a whole.

      <p class="description mbs">Hi, I'm Ryan. I am a 3rd year New Media student. I have been participating in the New Media club ever since I was a freshman. This club has been super important for me to get to know more people in the design community, to get to know more of my New Media classmates and peers, and to learn about new skills or ideas. That's why I've decided to run for the Treasurer e-board position for New Media Club. Next year I will be a senior, so I really want to be able to give back to the community that has had such an impact on me. To know more about me feel free to visit my introduction video. Thank you :)

      <p class="description mbs">Hi! My name is Jane, and I‚Äôm a 3rd year NMD student. On top of that, I love illustration and collecting funky stickers. I‚Äôd love to be on the NMC e-board and help the club that has supported me throughout my college education. As someone who has been in NMC since their freshman year, I believe I would be a good addition to the e-board as I would work hard to keep New Media Club the supportive and fun family it is today.

        <p class="description mbs">I am a third year New Media Design student, also minoring in psychology and mobile design & development!

        <p class="description mbs">Adit would be a great fit as he can do nearly anything one would need with a website. Design it? Sure. Code it? Got it! Enable others to easily manage and update it? Abso-*&^-lutely! Not only that, he has spent his life indulging in a variety of things like buisness strategy, marketing, some lowkey accounting, tax laws, and all kinds of weird stuff.

        <p class="description mbs">Hi, I'm Meg! This is my third year in New Media Design and New Media Club. I am a creator at heart and have a passion for user interaction and experience, social media, and advertising. Outside of the design world, I am an avid coffee drinker, movie-watcher and love to go hiking and travel (I miss this the most right now :( ). My favorite place I have ever traveled to is Kenya to see the Great Migration. I would love to be your Treasurer next year because I have always loved NMC and met a lot of great people and I want everyone to have the same experience and go to their great events!

In the past I've been on multiple eboards, including but not limited to treasurer and public relations manager. I also have plenty of experience with money from freelancing, managing funds from dozens of clients, and running online businesses. I've got lots of love in my heart for New Media, and I promise to serve the club  for the greater good of its members. I want us all to enjoy our time in NMC!

        <p class="description mbs">My name is Luke Chen, a second year New Media Design student. I was originally born in Fuzhou, China, then move to United States around 6 years ago. Fun fact about me is I've put a Minecraft sheep plushy in front of my zoom camera to see how Jason would react during class. If I am to be elected, I‚Äôll use the best of my ability to work with other members of the eboard to ensure this club serves as an environment where you can improve yourself to become a better designer, while also enjoy your time here and having fun.
